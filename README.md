# Gesture_detection

The Gesture Detection project is an advanced computer vision application that identifies and interprets hand gestures in real time. By leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and deep learning models, this system can recognize predefined hand movements and translate them into commands for various applications.

Gesture-based interaction is gaining popularity in fields like human-computer interaction (HCI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), home automation, and assistive technologies. This project provides a flexible framework to detect and classify gestures, making it possible to interact with devices without the need for physical contact.

Key Features are as following:
âœ… Real-time Gesture Recognition â€“ Uses a webcam to continuously track and recognize hand gestures.
âœ… Multiple Gesture Support â€“ Detects a variety of hand movements, such as thumbs up, open palm, fist, or custom gestures.
âœ… Highly Accurate Detection â€“ Uses pre-trained deep learning models and MediaPipe's efficient hand tracking.
âœ… Customizable Actions â€“ Map recognized gestures to specific commands or functions (e.g., controlling media playback, adjusting volume, or navigating slides).
âœ… Lightweight & Fast â€“ Optimized for real-time processing with minimal latency.
âœ… Cross-Platform Compatibility â€“ Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ Python â€“ Main programming language for implementation.
ðŸ”¹ OpenCV â€“ Used for image processing and webcam input handling.
ðŸ”¹ MediaPipe â€“ Provides efficient hand tracking and gesture recognition models.
ðŸ”¹ TensorFlow/Keras â€“ (Optional) Used for training custom deep learning models.
ðŸ”¹ NumPy & Pandas â€“ For data processing and analysis.
